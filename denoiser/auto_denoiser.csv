# This csv file is required to run the denoiser automatically for severeal stations.
# The file is read by the function denoiser.denoiser_utils.auto_denoiser and starts the denoising for all stations
# that are defined here.
# The data should be saved in SDS format. Also the denoised data data are saved in SDS format. For more information:
# https://www.seiscomp.de/seiscomp3/doc/applications/slarchive/SDS.html

# Required parameters:
# network: Name of the seismic network
# station: Name of the seismic station
# channel_code: Channel code of the station, e.g. EH, HH or BH
# channel_code_denoised: Channel code of the station after denoising, e.g. EX, HX or BX
# channel_direction: Channel directions of the station, e.g. ZNE or Z12
# type: 1 characters indicating the data type, recommended types are:
#	        'D' - Waveform data
#	        'E' - Detection data
#	        'L' - Log data
#	        'T' - Timing data
#	        'C' - Calibration data
#	        'R' - Response data
#	        'O' - Opaque data
# sds_dir: Base directory to read the data
# sds_out: Base directory to write the data
# dae_model: Full pathname of the denoising autoencoder model
# config: Full pathname of the config file for the DAE
# calib: Denoised data are multiplied by calib to avoid last bits in written data. Default is 1, but sometimes 100
#        is recommended.
#
# Optional parameters:
# location: Name of the location

# Note, if more parameters are needed or a different order of the parameters, please add them and change the order,
# as the file is read by pandas and only needs the required parameters as keywords.
# Add comments by adding "#" as a first element in your new line.
# Empty entries are allowed and are set by no whitespace between commas.
